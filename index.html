                <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Turina but I go by Chris.  I was born and raised in Portland my whole life.  I love Portland because all of the things I like to do are all within a couple hour drive from my house.  I love watching football, and being active.  My heart and soul are with the Seattle Seahawks.  I played lacrosse for Oregon State so I sweat orange and black.  The Beavers are my team!</p>

              <p class="para1">The Wiki page was an exercise where we were to create a copy of the home page of Wikipedia.  We had just learned how to incorporate bootstrapping into our html pages to make them look better.  Bootstrapping is a great to to have. </p>

              <p class="para1">The Resort page was an exercise where we were to create a resort.  The resort page was for a customer so we were supposed to give the customer a couple of options on the styling that they wanted done.  For this we were taught how to branch.  The branching made it so we could copy the master branch and be able to change the code around to try something else, all without changing the master branch.</p>
